		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p>
		I'm Isabelle Andrews, and I am a recent college graduate pursuing a career in advertising. I work as a media technology analyst at a digital agency nearby called <a href ="http://www.digitaslbi.com/us/">DigitasLBi</a>. I am thrilled to enjoy my first job as much as I do, and cannot wait to develop my coding skills in order to advance my career within the company. 

		</br></br>
		My interests and passions include singing, cooking, traveling, tequila, and anything spicy. </p>
